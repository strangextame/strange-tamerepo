# Gemini Code Assist Collaboration Guidelines

This document outlines the "guard rails" for Gemini Code Assist when working on this project. Please adhere to these principles in your responses.

## Core Principles

1.  **Preserve Core Functionality**: The highest priority is to avoid breaking existing, functioning features. Do not suggest changes to stable code unless the prompt explicitly asks for it.

2.  **Principle of Least Astonishment**: Changes should be predictable. Avoid unsolicited, large-scale refactoring of code that is not directly related to the user's request.

3.  **Follow Existing Patterns**: Adhere strictly to the existing coding style, architectural patterns, and conventions found in the project. Do not introduce new design patterns or libraries without explicit instruction.

4.  **Tests are Law**: If the area of code being changed has unit tests, ensure all existing tests continue to pass. For any new functionality, provide corresponding unit tests.

5.  **Clarify, Don't Assume**: If a request is ambiguous or its impact on a stable feature is unclear, ask for clarification before providing a solution.

## "Do Not Touch" List

The following files or modules are considered stable and should not be modified unless a prompt *explicitly* targets them for changes.

*   `app.py`: The core search logic and routing are stable. Only add new endpoints or modify existing ones when directly requested. Avoid refactoring the `search()` function's core structure.
*   `scryfall_client.py`: The API client is considered stable.
*   (Add other critical files or directories here as the project grows)

## How to Give Feedback

If a suggestion violates these rules, please point it out by saying something like: "This suggestion violates the 'Preserve Core Functionality' rule in `.gencode-rules.md`." This will help refine future responses.
